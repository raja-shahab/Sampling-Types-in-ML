    "**Quota sampling** is a non-probability sampling technique used in research where the population is divided into subgroups (or \"quotas\") based on specific characteristics such as age, gender, income level, etc., and participants are selected from each subgroup in proportion to their prevalence in the population. This method ensures that specific segments of the population are adequately represented in the sample."

    "**1. Non-Random Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike random sampling, participants are chosen non-randomly, based on the researcher's judgment or convenience, as long as the quota for each subgroup is fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Dividing the Population into Quotas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The population is divided into categories or quotas based on key characteristics relevant to the research (e.g., age, gender, income, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Proportional Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The sample aims to have the same proportion of individuals from each subgroup as exists in the overall population. For example, if 40% of the population is female and 60% is male, the sample would aim to have the same proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Filling Quotas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Researchers select participants until the required number (quota) for each subgroup is filled. They may select the easiest or most accessible participants for this."
