    "**Snowball Sampling** is a non-probability sampling technique used when itâ€™s difficult to find a specific population. In this method, existing participants help recruit future participants by referring people they know who fit the criteria for the study. The sample grows \"snowball-like\" as it accumulates more participants through referrals."

    "**How it Works:**\n",
    "1. Identify initial participants (called \"seeds\") who fit the research criteria.\n",
    "2. Ask these participants to refer others they know who meet the same criteria.\n",
    "3. The referred participants are included in the study and are also asked to refer more people.\n",

    "1. Efficient: Helps access hard-to-reach populations.\n",

    "**Cons:**\n",
    "1. Bias: The sample may not be representative of the entire population since participants are selected based on their social network.\n",
    "2. Limited Generalizability: Results are specific to the networks of the initial participants and may not apply to a broader population.\n",
    "3. Dependence on Social Networks: If the social networks are small or insular, it may be hard to reach a diverse group of participants."
