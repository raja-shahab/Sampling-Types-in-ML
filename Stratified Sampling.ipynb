    "Stratified Sampling is a method of sampling where a population is divided into smaller subgroups, or \"strata,\" that share similar characteristics. From each stratum, a sample is taken, and these samples are combined to form a complete sample that is representative of the entire population. This approach ensures that specific subgroups within a population are adequately represented in the sample."
