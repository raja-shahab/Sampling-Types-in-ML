    "**Convenience sampling** is a non-probability sampling technique where participants are selected based on their easy availability and proximity to the researcher. This method is often used in situations where quick, cost-effective data collection is needed, but it may lead to biased results since the sample may not accurately represent the larger population."

    "In this example, we demonstrated a basic implementation of convenience sampling using Python. By selecting a sample from a predefined population, we highlighted how easy access to participants can influence the sampling process. While convenience sampling can facilitate quick data collection, itâ€™s important to remember that the resulting sample may not accurately represent the larger population, potentially leading to biased outcomes. This method is useful for preliminary insights, but researchers should be cautious when generalizing findings."
