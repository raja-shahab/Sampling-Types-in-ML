    "**Cluster sampling** is a type of probability sampling method where the population is divided into separate groups, known as clusters, and a random selection of these clusters is then made to represent the population. Instead of sampling individuals directly, entire clusters (or groups) are sampled, and data is collected from all or some individuals within the selected clusters."

    "\n",
